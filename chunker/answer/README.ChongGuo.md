------------------

I first implemented basic version perceptron algorithm and got result about `92%`, and then I upgrade it to the averaged perceptron algorithm according to the last page of [this pdf](https://svn.spraakdata.gu.se/repos/richard/pub/ml2014_web/m7.pdf), the result increased to `93.622%`.

Finally I run the program several times and adjust the parameters for epoch_number and got the best result `93.679%`.
