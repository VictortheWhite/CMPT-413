# Homework 4 - Translation Decoding

## Chong Guo - 301295753

------------------

I first implemented baseline version code and then added the distortion limit and distortion parameter, but the result is only about `-1250` when `k=5000`, not as good as the one without distortion stuff (`-1228.206
` when `k=5000`).
